Homework for Week 7 - Update weather repl to do the following steps - 

x    Update the API Key as noted above, so that you are using your own key and not mine!
x    Change index.html and index.js so that you query weather by city and not by zip code.
x    Use units=Imperial to display in Fahrenheit.
    Check out - https://openweathermap.org/current for ideas on querying by city!
    Display the humidity and wind speed along with the other weather results. Keep existing code as is.
    Review section on parameters like humidity and wind speed - https://openweathermap.org/current
    Save the Repl and update your Github Repo for Weather with City.
