x    Update the API Key as noted above, so that you are using your own key and not mine!

x    Check out - https://openweathermap.org/current for ideas on querying by city!
x    Display the humidity and wind speed along with the other weather results. Keep existing code as is.
x    Review section on parameters like humidity and wind speed - https://openweathermap.org/current
